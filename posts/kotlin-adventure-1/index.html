      <div>
        
        <p>This is the beginning of my adventure with Kotlin and Mobile Development.</p>
<p>After years of working as a Microsoft Dynamics CRM/365 developer and teaching myself WPF, I wanted to try something entirely new: Mobile Development.</p>
<p>Before I tell you how I did anything without prior knowledge, I want to talk about what my goal was for this app.</p>
<p>I wanted to have an overview during a battle in DnD with easy access to the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who&rsquo;s turn it is</li>
<li>Who will be next</li>
<li>How many rounds have passed</li>
<li>How much time has passed in the gaming world</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I had no knowledge of how to do anything with Kotlin or Android, I started with the following tutorial: <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started">https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started</a>.
It&rsquo;s a good place to start to get basic knowledge.</p>
<p>After the tutorial I was already able to create the following proof-of-concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>The app contained seven hardcoded buttons with hardcoded strings.</li>
<li>The enabled button indicates the active player.</li>
<li>Clicking on the button ends the active players turn and will enable the next one.</li>
<li>When the last player had its turn, it will increase the number of rounds and time passed and reenable the first one on the list.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/2021-02/kotlin_ad_1_img_1.jpg" width="50%"/> 
</figure>

<p>This was a good start but unusable as everything was hard coded.</p>
<p>But that proof-of-concept showed me some major issues I haven&rsquo;t thought of before:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I add new players in general</li>
<li>How can I remove players</li>
<li>How can I add new players to an ongoing battle</li>
<li>How can I display all current players outside of a battle</li>
</ul>
<p>For the last issue, I was introduced to the concept of the <em>RecycleView</em> component. It always you to define design, place and space for a list and also design for the list-items. It is a rather complex concept and is best used together with <em>Fragments</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fragments</em> is another concept which I haven&rsquo;t touched yet and the current implementation of BattleCounter doesn&rsquo;t use it yet.
In short: You can use <em>RecycleView</em> without <em>Fragments</em>. It&rsquo;s probably not best practice, but for my use case it is good enough.</p>
<p>With the implementation of <em>RecycleView</em> component and more minor adjustments I got the following view:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/2021-02/kotlin_ad_1_img_2.jpg" width="50%"/> 
</figure>

<p>Next was adding new players to the existing list built for the <em>RecycleView</em>.
I was not well informed of how to send data from one activity to another.
Sending data between activities as well as the <em>Activity Lifecycle</em> is rather complex. Getting the app to work was more important at that time which is why I decided to use something called <em>companion object</em>.
A <em>companion object</em> in Kotlin is similar to a global object and every activity has access to it.</p>
<p>While developing the app I stumbled upon another interesting thing: How the relations between activities are set inside the AndroidManifest.xml. Having no previous knowledge with android development, I expected the relations to be defined inside the activities themselves and not on an extra file.</p>
<p>The last change I made for the first version was the overview of a battle with the buttons you can see in the first screenshot. What you see on the first screenshot was the result of forcing the code the work. The proof-of-concept was hardcoded and not worth going through.
The second version (sadly I didn&rsquo;t take a screenshot) is using a <em>LinearLayout</em>. Buttons were dynamically added as child elements and per default disabled. To enable the active player I needed to loop through the child elements to find to correct one. This solution is and was not perfect, but again, for my use case good enough.</p>
<p>With those changes I finally had an app that works just well enough. I could use it during a game and it provided the support I hoped to get.</p>
<p>You may have noticed this blog post was partly written one year ago as a documentation of what I&rsquo;ve done. Back then I believed I was done with this app.
By now I have made more minor changes to enhance the GUI and make it better looking on a tablet. I have more changes planned which I will cover in the next blog post as I need to dive deeper into Android development. You can expect more about the <em>Activity Lifecycle</em>, saving data with <em>Room</em>, <em>Navigation</em> and adding layouts for different targets.</p>
<p>This post was written in regard of the project <a href="https://github.com/WingedDemonFox/BattleCounter">BattleCounter</a> and describes the early stages.</p>
