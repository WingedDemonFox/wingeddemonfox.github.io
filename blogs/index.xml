      <description>This is the beginning of my adventure with Kotlin and Mobile Development.
After years of working as a Microsoft Dynamics CRM/365 developer and teaching myself WPF, I wanted to try something entirely new: Mobile Development.
My first choice was Xamarin, but previous experience in an educational environment wasn&amp;rsquo;t great and with recent changes in the .NET environment I decided against it.
So I started using Android Studio and Kotlin as programming language.</description>
