    <p>This is the beginning of my adventure with Kotlin and Mobile Development.</p>
<p>After years of working as a Microsoft Dynamics CRM/365 developer and teaching myself WPF, I wanted to try something entirely new: Mobile Development.</p>
<p>My first choice was Xamarin, but previous experience in an educational environment  wasn&rsquo;t great and with recent changes in the .NET environment I decided against it.</p>
<p>So I started using Android Studio and Kotlin as programming language.
And I immediately regret not taking the mobile course when I had the chance. Oh well.</p>
<p>Java was/is still the main programming language for B.Sc. in Computer Science. Although I worked with Java for a few years now, I am not proficient with it.
Which is why I went with Kotlin.</p>
<p>But before I tell you how I did anything without prior knowledge, I want to talk about what my goal was and why I decided to develop an app instead of a desktop application.</p>
<p>I want to have an overview during a battle in DnD with easy access to the following informations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who&rsquo;s turn it is</li>
<li>Who will be next</li>
<li>How many rounds have passed</li>
<li>How much time has passed in the gaming world</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I had no knowledge of how to do anything with Kotlin or Android, I started with the following tutorial: <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started">https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started</a>.
It&rsquo;s a good place to start to get basic knowledge.</p>
<p>After the tutorial I was already able to create the following proof-of-concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>The app contained seven hardcoded buttons with hardcoded strings.</li>
<li>The enabled button indicates the active player.</li>
<li>Clicking on the button ends the active players turn and will enable the next one.</li>
<li>When the last player had it&rsquo;s turn, it will increase the number of rounds and time passed and reenable the first one the list.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>This was a good start but unusable as everything was hard coded.</p>
<p>But that proof-of-concept showed me three major issues I haven&rsquo;t thought of before:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I add new players in general</li>
<li>How can I remove players</li>
<li>How can I add new players to an ongoing battle</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that I wanted was a list of current players regardless of an ongoing battle. For this to work I used the RecycleView, a concept which allows you to not only to define a list but also how those list-items should look like.
There are many different tutorials available regarding the RecycleView. I had to work through multiple to get it working. This was mostly due to the fact I haven&rsquo;t looked at fragments yet and wanted to only work through one component at the time.</p>
<p>With the RecycleView-Component and more implementations I got the following view:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/2021-02/kotlin_ad_1_img_2.jpg" width="50%"/> 
</figure>

<p>Next was adding new players to the existing list built for the recycleview.
I am not well informed of how to send data from one activity to another. Trying to follow some advice, I gave up and decided to use so called companion object.
From what I understand a companion object in Kotlin is something like a global object that every  activity can access.</p>
<p>And while setting the app together I stumbled upon another interesting thing: defining the relations of activities inside the AndroidManifest.xml. I honestly expected that I can define those relationships inside the activities and not add it to an extra file.</p>
<p>To be honest: the whole control of defining which button is active and which is not, was at first an absolute hack. But due to having to add buttons dynamically my first hack of simply adding all the buttons to one array and keep track through an index variable. But all in all it didn&rsquo;t change that much.
On the activity the buttons are added into a linearlayout and through that and hoping the order will be kept, I can iterate through the childelements and enable the one I need.
Well, first disable all and then enable :D</p>
<p>I was able to use the app during a game and it worked really well and helped me alot.</p>
<p>For me this app is completed.
I do have ideas for different changes, but honestly the only thing I think I might do is optimizing the app for smartphone as well and maybe add different color theme to it.</p>
<p>TLDR
Those were my first learnings working with Kotlin on mobile development</p>
<p>This post was written in regard of the project BattleCounter and describes the early stages.</p>
